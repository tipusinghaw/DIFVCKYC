# Idenfy - Empowering Trust with Reusable Identity and Seamless eKYC

Idenfy provides a comprehensive identity verification solution that leverages reusable digital identities and seamless eKYC, enabling businesses to verify identities quickly and securely. Built on top of Regula’s high-accuracy document and facial verification technology, Idenfy transforms paper credentials into cryptographically secure Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that users can use for fast, reusable authentication and approval.

## Key Features

1. **Identity Verification with Government-Issued Documents**  
   - Idenfy reads and validates details from official IDs, passports, and other government-issued documents using advanced document processing technology. This ensures both accuracy and compliance in identity verification.

2. **Fast and Secure eKYC**  
   - Idenfy’s high-speed eKYC processing allows users to complete identity verification in seconds, ensuring a smooth and efficient onboarding experience. This reduces lender risk and accelerates approvals, enhancing the customer journey.

3. **Advanced Biometric Verification**  
   - Idenfy utilizes a real-time liveness detection process to capture live images of users, ensuring that the individual is physically present. The captured image is then compared to the image on the government-issued document using Regula’s biometric matching technology, ensuring identity consistency.

4. **Reusable Digital Identity**  
   - Once the verification process is completed, a secure Verifiable Credential (VC) is issued through Crossmint’s API. This VC serves as a reusable digital identity, enabling users to securely access services and share their credentials when needed.

## How It Works

1. **Document Capture and Validation**  
   - Idenfy’s document reader technology scans government-issued credentials to capture and validate user information. The process ensures compliance with regulatory standards and helps prevent fraud.

2. **Real-Time Liveness Detection**  
   - During the verification process, a live image of the user is captured, ensuring that the person is physically present. This step helps protect against spoofing and identity fraud.

3. **Biometric Matching for Identity Verification**  
   - The real-time captured image is compared to the image on the government-issued document using Regula’s advanced biometric matching technology. This step guarantees that the captured image matches the document photo, ensuring identity accuracy.

4. **VC Issuance**  
   - Upon successful verification, Idenfy generates a cryptographically secure Verifiable Credential (VC) using Crossmint’s API. This digital identity can be accessed and shared securely, providing users with a reusable, authenticated identity.
